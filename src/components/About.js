        <p> Hello! My name is Halie, thanks for taking the time to look through my portfolio. I had been considering pursing a career in Web Development since 2019. A few bumps in the road and a global pandemic later, I decided to take the plunge and begin the pursuit in ernest in 2021. I started the part-time Web Development bootcamp with Nashville Software School in July of 2021 and continue through the curriculum, pushing myself every day.

        <br />
        <p> I am a Tennesse native, having grown up in Bristol, on the border of Tennesee and Virginia. I studied child psychology in college and moved to the Nashville area upon graduation in search of job opportunites. After a few years working for the state I decided I wanted something more. I had various friends and family working in the tech industry that inspired me to look into web development. I am so happy to be pursing a career - instead of just a job. I find myself enjoying the work more and more than I expected and I am so excited for the future.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p> I look forward to stepping into the industry as a woman who previously believed that would never have been an option. And I hope to inspire others that might feel the same way.
