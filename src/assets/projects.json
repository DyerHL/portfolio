It utilizes the React framework to build the app along with css styling and Firebase to store JSON data. Created to exercise knowledge in React routing and proptypes - this app met MVP by being able to create, read, update, and delete items. As well as, having a single view to read more details about a selected item, and using google authentication. The app also met team stretch goals to assign a 'favorite' attribute to an items and being able to view favorites in a seperate view. This app was completed over the course of 7 days by 4 students on a part-time basis."
